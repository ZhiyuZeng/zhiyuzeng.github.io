I am currently working as a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at the [Olin Business School](https://olin.wustl.edu/), Washington University in St. Louis. In 2023, I earned my Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University, where I was advised by [Prof. Zuo-Jun Max Shen](https://shen.ieor.berkeley.edu/). Prior to this, in 2018, I completed my bachelorâ€™s degrees in both Industrial Engineering and Business Administration, also at Tsinghua University.

**I will be on the job market in 2025!**

## Research Scope

MMy research examines operational challenges within digital platforms, adopting a causality-centric lens. I utilize data-driven causal inference, field experimentation, structural modeling, and machine learning techniques to analyze and enhance the strategies within online marketplaces. A particular focus of my work is on improving the incentives for both supply and demand sides of these digital ecosystems.
