<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>

<p>Over the past academic year, I taught two courses: <b>Text Mining</b> and <b>Prescriptive Analytics</b> at Olin Business School. These courses catered to both full-time masterâ€™s students and working professionals in flexible learning environments, covering both in-person and online formats. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with students praising the clarity of my lectures and the practical applications of the material.</p>

<h3>Course Overviews</h3>

<p><b>Text Mining</b> (Spring & Summer 2024) introduced students to powerful techniques for extracting valuable insights from unstructured text data, using methods like text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. Students learned how to apply these skills to real-world business problems in industries ranging from marketing to customer service. The course emphasized practical coding exercises using Python, along with a group project that required students to derive actionable insights for a business or organization.</p>

<p><b>Prescriptive Analytics</b> (Fall 2023) focused on optimization models that help businesses make data-driven decisions in areas such as supply chain management, production planning, and resource allocation. The course provided students with hands-on experience using industrial-strength tools like Python and Excel Solver to solve large-scale optimization problems. Delivered in a flipped classroom format, students watched lecture videos before attending interactive lab sessions, where they applied concepts through real-world case studies and group assignments.</p>

<h3>Quantitative Feedback</h3>

<p>For <b>Text Mining</b> (Spring 2024), the course received an overall rating of 9.67 out of 10, with key scores as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Clarity of instruction:</b> 9.33</li>
    <li><b>Engagement in discussions:</b> 9.67</li>
    <li><b>Answering student questions:</b> 9.78</li>
</ul>

<p>For <b>Text Mining</b> (Summer 2024), although there were fewer responses, the feedback was similarly positive, with an overall teaching effectiveness rating of 9.0.</p>

<p>For <b>Prescriptive Analytics</b> (Fall 2023), the course had a response rate of 69.23%, with an overall teaching effectiveness rating of 9.33 out of 10. Key scores included:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Clarity of instruction:</b> 9.33</li>
    <li><b>Encouragement of discussion:</b> 9.44</li>
    <li><b>Helpfulness outside of class:</b> 9.67</li>
    <li><b>Inclusive learning environment:</b> 9.67</li>
</ul>

<h3>Qualitative Feedback</h3>

<p>Students appreciated my enthusiasm and passion for teaching:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"I like that the professor is enthusiastic about the subject, and that she's been tailoring her teaching to students and adjusting based on their feedback. She is doing a wonderful job in her very first semester of teaching."</li>
    <li>"You have done a wonderful job in your first semester as a lecturer; I really enjoyed coming to your classroom!"</li>
    <li>"Prof tried her best!!! Keep going, you will be a great professor!"</li>
</ul>

<p>Students felt that my teaching was inclusive, that I listened to them, and was supportive:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"The willingness of the teacher to support students' learning."</li>
    <li>"Thank you for your openness and for making yourself available."</li>
</ul>

<p>Students also noted the clarity of my instruction and highlighted my ability to simplify complex concepts, making the content relevant to their future careers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Pretty practical."</li>
    <li>"The focus on analyzing text from different angles."</li>
</ul>
