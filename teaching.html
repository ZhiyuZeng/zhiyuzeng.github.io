<h2>Past Teaching Experience</h2>

<p>Over the past academic year, I taught two courses: <i>Text Mining</i> and <i>Prescriptive Analytics</i> at Olin Business School. These courses catered to both full-time masterâ€™s students and working professionals in flexible learning environments, covering both in-person and online formats. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with students praising the clarity of my lectures and the practical applications of the material.</p>


<h3>Course Descriptions</h3>

<h4>Text Mining (Spring & Summer 2024)</h4>
<p>This course explored methods for mining and analyzing large volumes of text data, a valuable resource in business operations, marketing, and public policy. Students learned key techniques such as text classification, summarization, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. The course combined theoretical content with practical coding exercises in Python, using Jupyter Notebooks. A key component of the course was the group project, where students applied their skills to real-world problems, pitching and delivering actionable insights for businesses.</p>

<h4>Prescriptive Analytics (Fall 2023)</h4>
<p>This course focused on optimization models used in business decision-making, particularly in areas such as supply chain management, financial investment, production planning, and resource allocation. Students were introduced to linear, integer, and non-linear programming models and learned to solve large-scale problems using industrial-strength optimization tools like Python and Excel Solver. The course was structured as a flipped classroom, where students engaged with lecture videos before applying the material in weekly lab sessions under my guidance.</p>

<h3>Quantitative Evaluations</h3>

<h4>Text Mining (Spring 2024)</h4>
<p>The course received an overall rating of 9.67 out of 10. Key scores include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Clarity of instruction:</b> 9.33</li>
  <li><b>Engagement in discussions:</b> 9.67</li>
  <li><b>Answering student questions:</b> 9.78</li>
</ul>

<h4>Text Mining (Summer 2024)</h4>
<p>ratings is 9.0 for teaching effectiveness and a strong appreciation for the practical elements of the course.</p>

<h4>Prescriptive Analytics (Fall 2023)</h4>
<p>The overall teaching effectiveness rating of 9.33 out of 10. Students rated the clarity of instruction at 9.33 and expressed high satisfaction with the practical applications of the material (9.67). Other metrics include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Encouragement of discussion:</b> 9.44</li>
  <li><b>Helpfulness outside of class:</b> 9.67</li>
  <li><b>Inclusive learning environment:</b> 9.67</li>
</ul>

<h3>Qualitative Feedback</h3>

<p>Students appreciated my enthusiasm and passion for teaching:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"I like that the professor is enthusiastic about the subject, and that she's been tailoring her teaching to students and adjusting based on their feedback. She is doing a wonderful job in her very first semester of teaching."</li>
    <li>"You have done a wonderful job in your first semester as a lecturer; I really enjoyed coming to your classroom!"</li>
    <li>"Prof tried her best!!! Keep going, you will be a great professor!"</li>
</ul>
