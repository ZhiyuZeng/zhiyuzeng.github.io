<h2>Bio</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> I'm an Assistant Professor at the Department of Management Science at <a href="https://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/acem2021/en/faculty/team.html"> Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>.
Between 2023 and 2025, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at the <a href="https://olin.wustl.edu/">Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis</a>, under the mentorship of <a href="http://denniszhang.org/"> Professor Dennis Zhang </a>. 
In 2023, I earned my Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://zj-maxshen.github.io/"> Professor Zuo-Jun Max Shen</a>. Earlier, in 2018, I received bachelor’s degrees in both Industrial Engineering and Business Administration, also from <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>.</p>
<!-- He also visited <a href = "https://www.purdue.edu/"> Purdue University</a>,
<a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a>, and <a href="https://www.tum.de/"> Technische Universität München</a> as an exchange student.
Currently he is working with Dr. <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/ffm5105/">Fenglong Ma</a>. Previously, he cooperated with Dr. <a href="https://asquicciarini.ist.psu.edu/">Anna Cinzia Squicciarini</a>, <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/cxg286/">Christopher Griffin</a>, and <a href="https://www.sarahrajtmajer.com/">Sarah Rajtmajer</a>. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> My research provides innovative solutions to the challenges faced by online platforms, using real data from industry and data-driven causal methods. I specialize in integrating structural modeling, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to complement field experiments and reduced-form analyses.</p>  
<!-- <p>My <b>main industry partner</b> is a top content-sharing platform, where boosting supply and demand is critical but challenging. A particular focus of my current work is providing solutions to increase both the supply and demand sides of these digital ecosystems. Collaborating with industry partners not only validates my findings but also allows my research to have a real impact on the industry.</p>	  -->
